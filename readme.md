# Responsive Boostrap based month range picker

## Context
* The [dangrossman/bootstrap-daterangepicker](https://github.com/dangrossman/bootstrap-daterangepicker) didn't provide a month range picker so we decided to initiate our own.
* Rklachko has tried to fork the above project [here](https://github.com/rklachko/bootstrap-daterangepicker/tree/month-view) with month view only, but it is unmaintained and has conflict with [dangrossman/bootstrap-daterangepicker](https://github.com/dangrossman/bootstrap-daterangepicker) if you use it.
* There is already a suggested idea [here](https://codepen.io/nathanfiscus/pen/qELYjG) by Nathan Fiscus, but in some context, we need it with more flexible options.
* Another existing component is proposed [here](http://yaireo.github.io/dateRangePicker/) by yairEO, but it is not responsive (Tether js issue we think).

* which has no conflict with **dangrossman/bootstrap-daterangepicker**,
